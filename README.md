# Media-Memorability

With the immense increase in the generation of video content on the Internet, video research and analysis has proved to be a budding area in research for which human cognition is required to be taken into account. Video memorability is one such cognitive measure which is the ability to recall the content after watching it. Memorability is an important area of study for industries like Marketing and Advertising, Entertainment, Online Study Camps, and Edu-Techs as it is directly proportional to the impact the video content can create. In this study, we have attempted to predict the short-term and long-term memorability using classic machine learning models. We use multiple features and their 
combinations to identify the contrast different models and recognize the model which is best at predicting long-term and short-term memorability.
